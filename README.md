# HTML About Me Page
## Overview: 
At the beginning of your coding career, it will be good to have a page that showcases yourself and your abilities. This can turn into a portfolio once we have more projects under our belt, but for now, let’s start with the most important person. You! We’ll use the concepts we learn in HTML and CSS to start you on the path to making a pretty page on the internet.

## Grading:
Ok, let’s start. In this assignment, we will grade you on your ability to make HTML and CSS your own. We will require the use of the following:
- Semantic HTML (Don’t use <div> unless there is a reasonable explanation)
- CSS
- CSS Grid
- CSS Flexbox

Along with those requirements, you should have the following sections on your page
- A header
- A main
- A footer
- An “About Me” section (or article) in the main
- Link(s) to your GitHub page, and/or your LinkedIn page
- A picture of you

## Tasks:
Start big and then go into detail:
1. Create a repository on GitHub and name it yourusername.github.io
-- Example: if my user name on GitHub is john-doe, then your repository name would be “john-doe.github.io”
2. Clone that repository down to your machine. 
3. Go to that folder and right-click on it (don’t go into the file). You may need to click on “Show more options,” but you are looking for the “Open with Code” option.
4. Now that we are in Visual Studio Code, we can now look at our explorer. If you opened the project correctly, you will only see the folder that has our repository name.
5. Right-click in the white space in your explorer and then select “New File” (you can also do this by clicking on the new file button to the right of the folder name) and name it “index. html”
-- To set up the starting HTML for the page, type ! and then hit enter. This will give you the boilerplate code for your HTML, including the <html> tag, <head> tag, and <body> tag
6. Do #5 one more time, but this time, name the file “site.css” (and don’t do the HTML setup)
7. Be sure to link the two files by adding the <link> tag to the head of index.html with a reference to site.css. 
8. Now you are ready to go! This should be fun, so what can you add (beyond the requirements) that will show your viewers who you are?
